Founded by Gautam Adani in 1988 as a commodity trading business, the Group's businesses include port management, electric power generation and transmission, renewable energy, mining, airport operations, natural gas, food processing and infrastructure.[13] More than 60 percent of the Adani Group's revenue is derived from coal-related businesses.[14]\n",
        "\n",
        "At its peak, Adani was the second largest Indian conglomerate, after Reliance Industries.[15] It lost more than $104 billion in value after fraud and market manipulation allegations by short-seller firm Hindenburg Research.[16] The Adani Group has also attracted other controversies due to reports of Stock manipulation, accounting irregularities, cronyism, tax evasion, Environmental damage, and sueing journalists.[17][18][19][20][21]\n",

        "History\n",
        "Adani Exports Limited started as a commodity trading company in 1988 and expanded into importing and exporting multiple commodities. With a capital of ₹5 lakhs, the company was established as a partnership firm with the flagship company Adani Enterprises, previously Adani Exports.[22] In 1990, the Adani Group developed its own port in Mundra to provide a base for its trading operations. It began construction at Mundra in 1995. In 1998, it became the top net foreign exchange earner for India Inc.[23] The company began coal trading in 1999, followed by a joint venture in edible oil refining in 2000 with the formation of Adani Wilmar.[24]\n",
        "\n",
        "Adani handled 4 Mt of cargo at Mundra in 2002, becoming the largest private port in India. Later in 2006, the company became the largest coal importer in India with 11 Mt of coal handling.[23] The company expanded its business in 2008, purchasing Bunyu Mine in Indonesia which has 180 Mt of coal reserves. In 2009 the firm began generating 330 MW of thermal power. It also built an edible oil refining capacity in India of 2.2 Mt per annum.[23]\n",
        "\n",
        "In 2010, Adani group with help of Petronet LNG will setup a solid cargo port through a Joint Venture company namely Adani Petronet (Dahej) Port Private Ltd., has already commenced its Phase 1 operations from August 2010 at Dahej Port. solid cargo port terminal would have facilities to import/export bulk products like coal, steel and fertilizer. PLL has 26% equity in this JV.[25][26]\n",
        "\n",
        "The Adani group became India's largest private coal mining company after Adani Enterprises won the Orissa mine rights in 2010.[27] Operations at the Port of Dahej commenced in 2011 and its capacity subsequently grew to 20 Mt. The company also bought Galilee Basin mine in Australia with 10.4 gigatonnes (Gt) of coal reserves. It also commissioned 60 Mt of handling capacity for the coal import terminal in Mundra, making it the world's largest.[citation needed]\n",
        "\n",
        "In 2011, the Adani group also bought Abbot Point port in Australia with 50 Mt of handling capacity. It commissioned India's largest solar power plant with a capacity 40 MW. As the firm achieved 3,960 MW capacity, it became the largest private sector thermal power producer in India. In 2012 The company shifted its focus on three business clusters – resources, logistics and energy.[28]\n",
        "\n",
        "Adani Power emerged as India's largest private power producer in 2014.[29] Adani Power's total installed capacity then stood at 9,280 MW.[30] On 16 May of the same year, Adani Ports acquired Dhamra Port on East coast of India for ₹5,500 crore (equivalent to ₹75 billion or US$940 million in 2020).[31] Dhamra Port was a 50:50 joint venture between Tata Steel and L&T Infrastructure Development Projects, which has been acquired by Adani Ports. The port began operations in May 2011 and handled a total cargo of 14.3 Mt in 2013–14.[32] With the acquisition of Dhamra Port, the Group is planning to increase its capacity to over 200 Mt by 2020.[33][34]\n",
